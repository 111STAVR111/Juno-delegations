# 1. Juno Delegation Program

Looking forward to the Juno Roadmap accomplishment, Juno needs a new revised a more focused delegation program. Targeting similar objectives of the Roadmap, the new program is focused on dAPP Developers, Infrastructure providers, and content creation.

## Objectives of the program

- Incentivize dAPP building on the Juno network stack
- Incentivize infrastructure services provided by validators
- Incentivize community activities and marketing
- Participation in network governance and discussions

## Delegation Program definition

With this program we are going to delegate a total of **15,000,000 $JUNO**.

Validators are free to apply to one, multiple or even all categories. Maximum points per validator are 70. Points will be discretionally assigned by the review committee and published after review is completed with reasonings.

### dAPPs

All the dAPPs built on Juno are eligible for a delegation, present past and future. Points will be assigned discrtionally by the review team based on the impact the dAPP has on the network in terms of user engagement, transaction fees, and other factors.

dAPPs deployed on multiple networks are eligible too, but Juno exclusive are rewarded more.

### Delegation calculation

Delegations will be propotional to the points earned by the specific validator in comparison to the total points assigned.

$$
\text{delegation} = \left( \frac{15{,}000{,}000}{\text{total points}} \right) \times \text{points of validator}
$$

### Who can Apply? Validator requirements

Validators need to match the following requirements in order to be eligible for a delegation:

1. Provide precise and timely information to the application form
1. Have all the onchain validator informations updated, including Moniker, security contact, logo, description
1. Validator commission should be equal or lower than 10%
1. Validator should not provide services like "commission rebate" for its own stakers
1. Validator should have an uptime of 95% or greater, at the moment of delegation reviewing.
1. Validator should never been slashed for double sign or downtime in the past year.
1. Have a validator created before April 2025, doesn't matter if in active set or not.

### Kintsugi Validator and Conflict of interest

Since Kintsugi will be one of the main reviewer of applications, we are going to publish here the points we propose to assign to ourseves, so that community can agree on this by voting the proposal.
