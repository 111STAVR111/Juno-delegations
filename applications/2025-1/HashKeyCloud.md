- Github URL：https://github.com/HashKeyCloud/cosmos-monitor
- Description of monitoring program:
  - Monitoring the signature rate of validators: real-time tracking of the signature status of nodes in each block to determine whether they participate in the consensus.
  - Monitoring on-chain proposal governance: tracking the creation, status changes, deadlines, etc. of governance proposals, so that validators can participate in voting in a timely manner.
  - Monitoring node block rate: assessing whether the node is producing blocks normally, detecting disconnection or performance abnormalities.
  - Email alert mechanism: once the node status is abnormal (such as a decrease in signature rate, no voting, stop producing blocks, etc.), the operation and maintenance personnel will be notified immediately by email to ensure that the problem can be responded to and handled in the first time.
